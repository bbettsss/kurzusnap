15-year-olds : mean mental well-being score (WHO-5)
Young people were asked how often over the last two weeks they had: felt cheerful and in good spirits; calm and relaxed; active and vigorous; woken up feeling fresh and rested; and felt their daily life was filled with things that interested them. Response options ranged from all the time to at no time and were combined to make a score (from zero to 100). Higher scores indicate higher mental well-being. Mean mental well-being score is presented here.
